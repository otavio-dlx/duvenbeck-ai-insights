## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Damage Claim Review (Priority: 1)
**Owner:** Muriel Berning

**Problem Statement:**
Liability review including "expert" assessment

- ROI: 3/5 - (no explanation in original table)
- Risk: 4/5 - Must be double-checked by employee. Negotiations still possible. Sometimes contains sensitive company data
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Savings in external and internal personnel expenses

**Project Brief (from provided data):**
- **Project Sponsor:** Muriel Berning
- **Involved Teams:** Claim / Insurance
- **Potential Conflicts:** none
- **Required Resources:** Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Damage documentation (images, damage reports, value proofs, etc.) / legal foundations + expertise
- **GenAI Considerations:** Access to existing damage software to create appropriate assessments.
- **Timeline:** Not specified
- **Additional Comments:** None

### 2. Document Administration and Email Summarization (Priority: 1)
**Owner:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection

**Problem Statement:**
Documentation/administration and summarization of email threads, documents, and contract reviews in filing system, each requiring creation of content descriptions in the filing system

**Proposed Solution:**
Automated assignment of documents to relevant files and content extraction with summary creation (automated case documentation)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 5/5 - No high complexity, because: pure reading of existing data; partly systems known that can already implement this
- Cost: 3/5 - Dependent on system landscape
- ROI: 5/5 - Very high through time savings in document filing, research and case processing
- Risk: 3/5 - Medium risk, as only existing content is read and no new results are generated
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Standardization; Reduction of administrative effort

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 3. Contract Insurance Review (Priority: 2)
**Owner:** Laura Krasniqi

**Problem Statement:**
Contract review - Liability & Insurance including checklist

**Proposed Solution:**
Creation of checklist including marking relevant passages, preliminary review if necessary, translation

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Data for checklist can be easily extracted. Only insurance topics relevant, not the entire contract. Provision of insurance coverage possible.
- Cost: 4/5 - Separate program required (contains confidential company data). Employee effort relatively low (reduction in workload).
- ROI: 3/5 - (no explanation in original table)
- Risk: 4/5 - Must be double-checked by employee to avoid coverage gaps.
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Faster customer responses = improved customer satisfaction. Savings in employee effort

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 4. Legal Document Creation (Priority: 2)
**Owner:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection

**Problem Statement:**
Creation of legal briefs, lawsuits, responses to lawsuits, letters etc.; Creation of questionnaires and conversation guides; Creation of contract templates, templates for guidelines, data protection notices and other documents as well as insertion into existing templates (e.g. also in processing descriptions, logistics contracts, employment contracts)

**Proposed Solution:**
Use of research results, case summaries etc. for creation of texts in legal tone using predefined templates including from beck-online database; After providing the facts, processing and drafting of questions; Text creation based on bullet points and topic blocks, creating and inserting into predefined templates

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Contract creation: more complex; Creation of legal briefs and processing descriptions: not so complex
- Cost: 3/5 - Medium to high investment costs; ongoing costs dependent on usage and API queries
- ROI: 5/5 - Very high: significant time savings for recurring tasks (e.g. drafts, statements, internal feedback). Reduces research and formulation effort.
- Risk: 3/5 - Medium: Risks concern content accuracy, data confidentiality in external processing (e.g. when using online databases) and copyright. Well manageable through clear governance and manual final control
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Automation, time savings, standardization, acceleration

**Project Brief (from provided data):**
- **Project Sponsor:** Legal
- **Involved Teams:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection
- **Potential Conflicts:** Other departments as users of templates
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Desired structure and content must be specified, templates must be provided, case summaries must be provided
- **GenAI Considerations:** LLM tool required, proper use/formulation of prompts and selection of appropriate prompts
- **Timeline:** Not specified
- **Additional Comments:** None

### 5. Legal Chatbot (Priority: 3)
**Owner:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection

**Problem Statement:**
Small, recurring cases and questions

**Proposed Solution:**
Chatbot

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Medium: Building internal knowledge pool, training AI on company-specific content and ongoing maintenance necessary. Technically well implementable with existing solutions.
- Cost: 3/5 - One-time implementation and continuous maintenance by Legal (DUV GPT could be used after implementation)
- ROI: 4/5 - Relatively high: Relieves team from routine inquiries, reduces processing times, increases response speed. Strong productivity gain in daily business. More difficult to apply in weighing of interests
- Risk: 2/5 - Higher risk: Accuracy of keywords error-prone
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Direct response, quick initial assessment, process acceleration

**Project Brief (from provided data):**
- **Project Sponsor:** Legal
- **Involved Teams:** Legal, Data Protection
- **Potential Conflicts:** Insurance, Claim Management, Accounting
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Provision of information and answers in the form of playbooks; Documents and information from specialist departments required for assessment and answering of questions
- **GenAI Considerations:** Question-answer model based on simple if-then specifications
- **Timeline:** Not specified
- **Additional Comments:** None

### 6. Contract Analysis (Priority: 4)
**Owner:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection

**Problem Statement:**
Review and analysis of standards (NDA, CoC, IT-GTC, DPA etc.) as well as non-standardized contracts

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic review and summarization including consideration of predefined rules (OTRIS AI solution)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Medium to high: Depends on rule variety and document structure. AI must understand both legal language and specific company rules and be able to apply them.
- Cost: 2/5 - Costs through OTRIS (add-on to OTRIS) relatively low, as system already exists and it's just an add-on
- ROI: 5/5 - High time savings once implemented; Creation of playbook requires increased time investment upfront
- Risk: 3/5 - Low to medium: Low risk with internal use; external cloud solution requires data protection and security review. Risk of incorrect assessments with incomplete rules.
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Very good fit: Strengthens quality assurance, standardization and traceability. Supports digital transformation of legal department and promotes consistency.

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 7. Meeting Summarization (Priority: 5)
**Owner:** Legal, Compliance & Data Protection

**Problem Statement:**
Negotiation summarization / Meeting summarization / Conversation summarization

**Proposed Solution:**
Automated transcription / Summarization

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Less complex: Speech recognition, topic analysis and summarization are technically well manageable. Additional requirements for legally secure storage and possibly multilingualism.
- Cost: 3/5 - Medium: Dependent on solution (e.g. internal AI, MS Copilot, third-party). Ongoing costs low when using existing systems.
- ROI: 4/5 - Relatively high: Saves considerable time in post-processing and improves documentation quality. Reduces risk of losing important points.
- Risk: 3/5 - Medium risk: Risk with data protection compliant use controllable
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Standardization of documentation, increased digitalization and quality

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 8. Risk Analysis Automation (Data Protection) (Priority: 6)
