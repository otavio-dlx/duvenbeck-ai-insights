## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Market Analysis Automation (Priority: 1-A)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
High time investment for market and competitive analyses, which are often not up to date

**Proposed Solution:**
AI tools aggregate data in real-time and automatically create concise market overviews

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Not complex; however, some data is only available in download documents or behind paywalls. Regular updates/extensions of parameters may be necessary
- Cost: 4/5 - Costs may only be necessary for certain tools/websites (e.g., Orbis). Some licenses already available
- ROI: 3/5 - ROI not measurable as analysis only represents decision support → Time savings very high
- Risk: 4/5 - Risk: Reports are not being used
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Data helps in analyzing possible strategic directions and in decision-making/review with shareholders = Data driven

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** Corporate Development
- **Involved Teams:** All C-Level resorts for alignment on scope of reports and topics that are relevant (Finance; Operations especially regarding production planning)
- **Potential Conflicts:** None // At most: Innovation and IT due to trend alerts
- **Required Resources:** No budget necessary, only resources for initial definition of reporting and search criteria
- **Data Availability:** Internal data on company performance for comparison (e.g., Rev, EBITDA, FTE Amount, PEX, Shipments etc.) + existing information about production planning etc.
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones: Necessary to check if data is validly pulled from WWW
Pilot design: Not necessary; reporting only for C-Level/Extended Management
Ethics and data protection: Not applicable = work only with published data
Scalability: not necessary
Change management: Not necessary
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** Validate concrete use of data = goal is to generate action measures and recommendations (e.g., personnel reduction VW = fixed cost reduction DUV)

### 2. Strategic Scenario Planning (Priority: 6)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
Strategic decisions: fast and with many variables

**Proposed Solution:**
AI-supported scenario simulations model different strategies and their potential impacts

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 5/5 - No complexity. By stating objectives, possible alternatives can be quickly brainstormed and scenarios evaluated faster
- Cost: 3/5 - Cannot be assessed
- ROI: 3/5 - No ROI; Support in decision-making and faster strategy adjustment due to changed framework conditions = No lengthy strategy workshops potentially necessary = Cost savings + Faster top-down implementation of goals and measures per resort and partially department + Savings in consulting costs
- Risk: 5/5 - Wrong questions/info leads to wrong plans and mismatched goals
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - 3-5 different strategy reviews were done in 3 years = Helps with regular updates and readjustments = Securing info from knowledge holders (C-Level fluctuation)

### 3. Customer Profitability Analysis (Priority: 3-A)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
Decisions about investments or divestments are complex

**Proposed Solution:**
AI evaluates existing projects and investments based on KPIs, risk, and growth potential and provides recommendations

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Many data points needed from various tools (SAP, customer portal, local and central) as well as documented problems and processes to define optimization potential. Financial metrics available but other topics mostly not centrally stored = Many knowledge holders
- Cost: 4/5 - Low costs, only in-house data + irregular queries (1x per quarter per customer ??)
- ROI: 2/5 - Low ROI; Helps with quick analysis
- Risk: 2/5 - High risk if assumptions are incorrect and customer conversations are interpreted negatively
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Necessary; wanted by CEO and helps achieve goals (EBITDA) as objective decisions can be made about expansion or exit of customer relationships

### 4. Competition Trend Alerts (Priority: 1-B)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
New competitors, technologies, or business models are often recognized too late

**Proposed Solution:**
AI continuously monitors market trends and competitor activities and creates alerts for relevant changes

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Not complex; however, some data is only available in download documents or behind paywalls. Regular updates/extensions of parameters may be necessary
- Cost: 4/5 - Costs may only be necessary for certain tools/websites (e.g., Orbis). Some licenses already available
- ROI: 3/5 - ROI not measurable as analysis only represents decision support → Time savings very high
- Risk: 4/5 - Risk: Reports are not being used
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Data helps in analyzing possible strategic directions and in decision-making/review with shareholders = Data driven

### 5. Dashboard Reporting (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
High effort, no standards, little uniform definition in the group

**Proposed Solution:**
Brainstorming and development of standardized templates for all dashboards (Excel + PPT Export)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Many data needed from various tools (SAP, customer portal etc.)
- Cost: 4/5 - Data exports/interfaces etc. necessary to generate live real values
- ROI: 5/5 - Many FTEs in the group busy with reporting tasks + updates. Through automation, especially in controlling, various times can be used more efficiently
- Risk: 5/5 - No risk; Internal data. At most misinterpretation or wrong definitions
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - To make agile and fast decisions, ZDF is needed at the push of a button = At the same time high reporting effort towards shareholders can be reduced and standardized = M&A necessity = Data and reporting structures necessary for possible shareholder exit

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** CEO + COO serves as steering and management element + CIO due to system dependency
- **Involved Teams:** Operations + Controlling + PowerBI Team = Use of existing data and reports to standardize/optimize and automate them
- **Potential Conflicts:** Currently possibly ongoing project: KPI Based Steering (WPE requirements)
- **Required Resources:** Personnel necessary for data consolidation
- **Data Availability:** Much data available in Caro, customer portal, SAP, PowerBI = Are not centrally consolidated or definitions don't match or are not exported from systems or further processed = often alignment with other systems necessary to ensure data completeness (e.g., transfer ETA ACTUAL and TARGET)
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones: //
Pilot design: Not necessary; reporting only for C-Level/Extended Management
Ethics and data protection: Not applicable = work only with internal data = personal data = performance KAM =
Scalability: not necessary
Change management: Not necessary
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** Coordination with C-Level and WPE regarding alignment on scope and already existing// missing reports = especially CXO and COO

### 6. Contract Database (Priority: 3-B)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
Renegotiations, deviations TARGET vs ACTUAL in contracts

**Proposed Solution:**
Scan of SLAs/contracts and comparison with ACTUAL values in the system

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 1/5 - Very high complexity because many TARGET data like volume are only shared sporadically by customers, or only available retrospectively = Simultaneously many documents and contracts not digitized = Basically every contract and all SLAs (which change regularly) would always need to be updated
- Cost: 3/5 - High manual updating/centralization effort
- ROI: 5/5 - Deviations and potential for renegotiations quickly and potentially proactively identifiable by AI. = Currently only checked if delivered according to contract in case of negative events or P&L result. Bonus-malus agreements are partially checked by customers and transmitted to DUV = Review and correction can be replaced by AI thus freeing resources for other topics
- Risk: 4/5 - No risk; In-house data
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - ...

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** CCO + CXO
- **Involved Teams:** COO + Site Management + Legal (Contract Management)
- **Potential Conflicts:** Central Sales vs. Decentralized Management
- **Required Resources:** Digitization and harmonization of SLA + contract data if not available in the system. Budget: None
- **Data Availability:** Contracts are available in legal systems and CRM = Completeness verification necessary
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones: Necessary
Pilot design: If tool is to be made available to sites then necessary
Ethics and data protection: Not applicable = work only with internal data
Scalability: N/A
Change management: N/A
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** -

### 7. Product Portfolio Extension (Priority: 5)

**Owner:** -

**Problem Statement:**
High effort to identify individual service extensions for customers

**Proposed Solution:**
(Empty - no solution provided)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Once database with all customer contracts is available, it's easy to do gap analysis and check where upscaling is possible or not + Business solution can be sketched by AI and potential white spots identified
- Cost: 4/5 - No high costs
- ROI: 4/5 - Quick analysis and KAM plans can be created
- Risk: 0/5 - No risk
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Growth, cross-selling and customer development desired and required. Entry barriers with existing customer base lower than new acquisition
