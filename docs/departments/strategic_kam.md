## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Automated procurement of news and potentially required new service (Priority: 1)

**Owner:** MGE

**Problem Statement:**
Much manual effort and research required to find out how a customer stands economically overall and what new service types they might need

**Proposed Solution:**
AI-supported analysis of the described points, automated notification about news in any direction

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - News-crawling basically simple. Connection to CRM increases the effort. No intervention in critical systems necessary.
- Cost: 4/5 - CRM connection/integration? Licensing?
- ROI: 4/5 - Cost/benefit not directly derivable. Assumption: Research and preparation effort 1h/per customer. Could be reduced to 15 minutes
- Risk: 4/5 - No sensitive customer data necessary. Main danger lies in misjudgments or "hallucinations" of the AI, but controllable through human validation.
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Growth

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** Sales Leader KAM
- **Involved Teams:** KAM / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** Sales cross-functional added value
- **Required Resources:** Testers from the KAM team, IT for implementation
- **Data Availability:** All relevant data is available online. Rules for processing to narrow down the relevant information.
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones: Initial tests with Co-Pilot (Is included in Teams and complies with data protection)
  Pilot design: Use of CO-Pilot or own/other AI solution (depending on possibility for individualization) 
  Ethics and data protection: Since only publicly retrievable data is processed, no high risk
  Scalability: Arbitrarily scalable - except if limitation in AI licensing exists
  Change management: Brief training of sales users + work instructions in written form + sensitization for evaluation of data (fake news)
- **Timeline:** Prototype milestones: 1 month
  Pilot design: 3 months
  Ethics and data protection: 1 month
  Scalability: 1 month
  Change management: 1 month
- **Additional Comments:** -

### 2. Automated recommendations and support in CRM system (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** MGE

**Problem Statement:**
High manual effort in the CRM system due to data collection and maintenance

**Proposed Solution:**
The AI provides suggestions in the CRM for the input fields and supports keeping data current (opportunities etc.). Text fields are filled with suggestions that can be adopted or adjusted (Client Plan)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - e.g. use existing Co-Pilot
- Cost: 1/5 - License costs (per user) can quickly become expensive
- ROI: 2/5 - difficult to measure
- Risk: 2/5 - Microsoft is already used as CRM and Co-Pilot is a component of it. The security precautions are therefore based on the Microsoft standards, which we would rate as very high.
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Transparency - Basic tool of sales. Sales has the greatest influence on fulfilling the Duvenbeck strategy.

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** CRM-Team
- **Involved Teams:** CRM-Team, IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** Sales Overall
- **Required Resources:** Co-Pilot licenses for all users
- **Data Availability:** Data foundation, rule framework and review for the recommendations
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones: Activation of the Co-Pilot function
  Pilot design: Introduction of rule framework and review of recommendations and suggestions
  Ethics and data protection: Data protection agreement from all CRM users is already signed and available.
  Scalability: Should be no limitation with appropriate licensing
  Change management: Training of CRM users via the key users
- **Timeline:** Prototype milestones: 1 month
  Pilot design: 3 months
  Ethics and data protection: 1 month
  Scalability: 1 month
  Change management: 1 month
- **Additional Comments:** Quality of the suggestions

### 3. AI takes over initial contract review (Priority: 3)

**Owner:** MGE

**Problem Statement:**
KAMs review initial contracts or contract renewals for unacceptable passages and the contractually requested service scope - are we able to fulfill this?

**Proposed Solution:**
Use of an LLM to review specific contract constellations

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - legally and linguistically complex.
- Cost: 4/5 - AI costs low, as one document. legal validation possibly expensive
- ROI: 3/5 - Depends on the customer. If reaction time is long, no time advantage. lower error rate - overlooking relevant information can reduce follow-up costs
- Risk: 1/5 - Legal relevance, potential misinterpretations, liability issues. Service catalog, use of sensitive contract data (data protection review)
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Standardization - "Avoidance" of possible expenses / costs

**Project Brief:** _Not available yet_
