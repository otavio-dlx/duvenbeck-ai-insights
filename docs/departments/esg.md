## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Automatic Calculation + Processing of Customer Requests (Priority: 1)

**Owner:** Maximilian Schwarz

**Problem Statement:**
Customer requests for CO2 balancing at transport level, etc.

**Proposed Solution:**
Collection of freight letters or other parameters for calculating CO2 per transport, shipment, etc. (Shipzero tool)

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 1/5 - Automation of many data points
- Cost: 4/5 - Evaluated based on Shipzero contract
- ROI: 4/5 - Among other things, important for new customer business
- Risk: 2/5 - Missing or incorrect values could affect customer relationships
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Certification necessary, also strategically important for a variety of stakeholders

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** C-Board / ESG
- **Involved Teams:** ESG / IT / PMO / SALES
- **Potential Conflicts:** Possible with IT; e.g., integration of tool via interface (IT integration team already serves other internal interests)
- **Required Resources:** Project team: approx. 4 employees, budget incl. staff + technology during project period ~ â‚¬150,000 (?)
- **Data Availability:** Parameters available in freight letters, provision of conversion factors + certified calculation methodology necessary
- **GenAI Considerations:** User-centered test phases with feedback loops
- **Timeline:** Module for calculating transport emissions should be completed by the end of 2025,
  Milestone 1: Data provision by DUV by 11/2025
  Milestone 2: Data integration into existing technology by mid-12/2025
  Milestone 3: Test phase of initial data runs + subsequent optimization by the end of 12/2025
- **Additional Comments:** null

### 2. AI-Supported Data Collection (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** Maximilian Schwarz

**Problem Statement:**
Creating necessary KPIs and building the data foundation

**Proposed Solution:**
Support/automation of data collection + data quality

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 1/5 - Automation of a variety of data
- Cost: 3/5 - Flat rate
- ROI: 3/5 - Among other things, the report is expected to become part of the annual reporting in 2027 + customer requirement
- Risk: 1/5 - Flat rate, as fixed reporting framework does not yet exist
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Legal requirement

**Project Brief:**
To be developed

### 3. Automatic Collection of All Necessary Data + CO2 Emissions Calculation (Priority: 3)

**Owner:** Maximilian Schwarz

**Problem Statement:**
Annual creation of Corporate Carbon Footprint (GES CO2) - Scope 3

**Proposed Solution:**
Tracking, calculation, etc. of Scope 3 emissions (mostly very unclear) for e.g., employee commuting, waste, etc.

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Many unknown parameters must be collected; if not possible, standardized extrapolation must be performed
- Cost: 3/5 - Flat rate
- ROI: 5/5 - Among other things, important for new customer business
- Risk: 5/5 - Missing or incorrectly calculated values can influence CO2 balancing
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Contributes to the above legal requirements

**Project Brief:**
To be developed

### 4. AI-Supported Data Processing (Priority: 4)

**Owner:** Maximilian Schwarz

**Problem Statement:**
Time-consuming creation of monthly ESG Master KPIs

**Proposed Solution:**
Automated creation of Master KPIs through data foundation

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Automation of many data points
- Cost: 3/5 - Flat rate
- ROI: 2/5 - Rather qualitative benefit
- Risk: 4/5 - Master KPIs for internal use
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Important for ESG strategy

**Project Brief:**
To be developed

### 5. AI-Supported Text Creation (Priority: 5)

**Owner:** Maximilian Schwarz

**Problem Statement:**
Creating text modules for reporting.

**Proposed Solution:**
Automated creation of respective ESRS text modules

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 5/5 - Creation of text modules for reporting
- Cost: 2/5 - Flat rate
- ROI: 3/5 - Among other things, the report is expected to become part of the annual reporting in 2027 + customer requirement
- Risk: 1/5 - Flat rate, as fixed reporting framework does not yet exist
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Legal requirement

**Project Brief:**
To be developed

## Implementation Notes

The ESG initiatives focus on automating CO2 calculation, data collection, and reporting processes to meet legal requirements and customer demands. The Automatic Calculation initiative is prioritized highest with completion planned by the end of 2025, addressing both customer business opportunities and regulatory compliance. All initiatives emphasize strategic importance due to legal requirements and stakeholder expectations.
