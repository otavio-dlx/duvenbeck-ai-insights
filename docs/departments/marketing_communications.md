**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Different media are used for campaigns (e.g. MS Dynamics, agencies have different analytic tools, LinkedIn Paid)
- Cost: 3/5 - Costs depend on the channel and how often campaigns are run and how large the target group is (fixed costs - if through agency, variable costs - if DUV runs it on media itself)
- ROI: 4/5 - the more precise the campaign, the better you reach the target group and the better the outcome
- Risk: 5/5 - Customer data is protected by NDA, the outcome is anonymized, therefore uncritical | internal use
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5

- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Conserves resources that can be used for strategic topics + brand identification

**Project Brief:**
To be developed

### 5. Image Generation (Priority: 5)

**Problem Statement:**
Greater selection of relevant press images taking into account the new corporate identity, for the press kit with rights at Duvenbeck

**Proposed Solution:**
We provide specifications and an image generation tool creates suggestions

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - probably easy to implement with the right tools
- Cost: 3/5 - Marketing images are very expensive due to licensing costs, which depend on media and use in countries as well as frequency (1-time use, multiple use), PR images are cheaper, BUT copyright is a big issue (PR images may not be used as marketing images)
- ROI: 2/5 - One-time shooting per year: Long-term sustainability, the images are definitely on brand, licenses (rights) are not an issue
- Risk: 1/5 - the legal side of image generation is viewed as very critical from our information perspective + the quality of generated images
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5

**Project Brief:**
To be developed
