## AI Initiatives Summary

The Controlling department identified 3 key AI initiatives:

| Priority | Initiative             | Owner      | Priority Level | Complexity | Cost | ROI | Risk | Strategic |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---- | --- | ---- | --------- |
| 1        | Fleet Performance Analysis | Angelika   | A              | 2/5        | 1/5  | 4/5 | 5/5  | 4/5       |
| 2        | Presentation Creation  | Jan        | A              | 2/5        | 3/5  | 1/5 | 1/5  | 4/5       |
| 3        | Intensive Research     | Max        | A              | 1/5        | 2/5  | 3/5 | 1/5  | 2/5       |

## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Fleet Performance Analysis (Priority: 1)

**Owner:** Angelika

**Problem Statement:**
Productivity of own fleet
Tour ID

**Proposed Solution:**
- Automated creation of Tour-ID to identify when 2 or more Car_O tours are combined into a round trip
- Use Fleetboard for automatic route and productivity analysis - Comprehensive analysis of relevant fleet performance KPIs

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Productivity analysis regarding various KPIs, different transfer prices complicate matters, planning bases and assumptions not identical, round trip detection desired, early detection of deviations through partial live evaluation
- Cost: 1/5 - Programming effort, licenses, (ABO)
- ROI: 4/5 - Fleet optimization, cost reduction, revenue increase, prevention of empty runs and detours
- Risk: 5/5 - No highly sensitive data in application
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Develop strategies regarding fleet utilization

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** Johanna Blanke/ Angelika Scheicher
- **Involved Teams:** Controlling, FP-Disposition, DUVIS-Team
- **Potential Conflicts:** - Resource overlap: DUVIS-Team, FP-Disposition, Controlling
- Implementation of new TMS
- Not all locations use (the same) telematics
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** FP-Productivity: GPS data from trucks/ travel data available / driver card data available--> Define deviation analysis
Tour ID: Cross-trip Tour-ID not yet available
- **GenAI Considerations:** Milestone: Validation of feasibility:
Scalability: 80% of the fleet uses the same telematics system / 
Tour ID: TMS transition in the next two years, therefore no uniform use of TMS during this time
- **Timeline:** 
- **Additional Comments:** 

### 2. Presentation Creation (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** Jan

**Problem Statement:**
MEC, Ad hoc PPT ...

**Proposed Solution:**
- Use of AI for automated PPT creation with CI templates
- Focus on content-based PPT
- Automated image, text, and format selection

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 2/5 - Multiple data sources (e.g., IDL, Lukanetz, CAR_O), different presentation levels (BUKRS <> PC), variance analysis of key KPIs, summary of topics based on predefined PPT structure, at Company-Level, BU-Level and Group-Level
- Cost: 3/5 - Programming effort, licenses, (ABO)
- ROI: 1/5 - CO support, time savings in Controlling
- Risk: 1/5 - Sensitive data, comprehensive financial values from all areas
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Support for communication with different shareholders

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** Jan Braukmüller
- **Involved Teams:** Controlling, IT, HR, Sales, ESG, PMI, M&A
- **Potential Conflicts:** Resource overlaps exist in all departments
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Must be reviewed and defined with all involved teams
- IDL, Lucanet, etc.
- **GenAI Considerations:** Milestone: Validation of feasibility: first test on one BU (e.g. PCL)
Scalability: especially in M&A not 100% possible initially
- **Timeline:** 
- **Additional Comments:** 

### 3. Intensive Research (Priority: 3)

**Owner:** Max

**Problem Statement:**
Time-intensive research for analysis of historical revenue, years/months/quarters, prices, contract situations etc.

**Proposed Solution:**
- AI-supported data collection
- Structured data consolidation
- Automated report generation with key insights

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 1/5 - Multiple data sources, complex initial setup, linking of different data,
- Cost: 2/5 - Programming effort, licenses, (ABO), initial development
- ROI: 3/5 - CO support, time savings across many involved departments
- Risk: 1/5 - Sensitive data, comprehensive financial values from all areas, additionally from operational areas
- Strategic Alignment: 2/5 - Primarily internal use

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** Maximilian Göckener
- **Involved Teams:** Legal, Sales, SL, CO, HR, SAP, Facility, FP, Treasury, IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** - Resource overlaps exist in all departments
- Conflicts between departments regarding data protection
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Must be reviewed and defined with all involved teams
- **GenAI Considerations:** Milestone: Validation of feasibility / Definition of which data should/may be made available
Data protection: who may receive which information
- **Timeline:** 
- **Additional Comments:** 

## Implementation Notes

The Controlling initiatives focus on automating data analysis and reporting processes to improve decision-making efficiency. The fleet performance analysis is prioritized highest due to its potential for significant cost reduction and revenue increase through optimized fleet utilization.
