## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Target Prices (Priority: 1)

**Owner:** HMI

**Problem Statement:**
Target prices make up 50% of inquiries, often without profit

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic creation of target prices as indications

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Input of standard information/basic data analogous to CCT
- Cost: 4/5 - Higher usage, simple data processing/technical implementation
- ROI: 5/5 - Reduction of calculation effort, freeing up resources for projects
- Risk: 5/5 - Target price, no contractual binding
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - No resource binding, concentration on important/strategic projects

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TBA / TRI
- **Involved Teams:** SD / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Data available
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection
  Cost breakdown, resource overview
- **Timeline:** Q2 / 2026
- **Additional Comments:**

### 2. Requirements Specification Summary (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** TBA

**Problem Statement:**
Requirements specification summary and interpretation

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic information about the most important points with 'filtering' by department, project area

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Experience: Weighting of information essential, languages; wording, accuracy of information but on the other hand pure information processing
- Cost: 4/5 - Low effort/usage, programming effort however given
- ROI: 3/5 - Small group of people who come in contact with it, only data summarization, time savings for initial document review
- Risk: 3/5 - Inaccuracy can lead to misinterpretation
- Strategic Alignment: 2/5 - Qualitative decision support, time savings for employees

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TRI / TBA
- **Involved Teams:** SD / BD / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Requirements specifications are available
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection due to customer documents, structure and scope of documents, correct definition of keywords + continuous development
- **Timeline:** End of 2026
- **Additional Comments:** Legal clarification of data protection

### 3. Contract Reviews/Document Reviews (Priority: 3)

**Owner:** NKO

**Problem Statement:**
Contract reviews and document reviews

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic detection of major deviations from DUV standard

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 5/5 - Search for keywords, interpretation help
- Cost: 5/5 - Low effort/usage, programming effort however given
- ROI: 4/5 - Small group of people who come in contact with it, interpretation help, time savings for decision makers
- Risk: 1/5 - Misinterpretation can lead to high follow-up costs, data security with confidential customer information?
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Risk management

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TRI / TBA / Legal
- **Involved Teams:** SD / BD / Legal / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** DUV standard contract
  Sample contract
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection due to customer documents, structure and scope of documents, correct definition of keywords + continuous development
- **Timeline:** Mid 2027
- **Additional Comments:** Legal clarification of data protection

## Implementation Notes

The Contract Logistics initiatives focus on automating pricing, requirements analysis, and contract review processes to free up resources for strategic projects. The Target Prices initiative is prioritized highest with the most significant impact on resource allocation, scheduled for Q2/2026. All initiatives emphasize the importance of data protection due to confidential customer information.
