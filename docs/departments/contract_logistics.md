## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Requirements Specification (Priority: 2)

**Owner:** TBA

**Problem Statement:**
 Requirements Specification Summary 

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic information about the most important points with "filtering" by department, project area

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 3/5 - Experience: Weighting of information absolutely necessary, languages; wording, accuracy of information
but on the other hand pure information processing
- Cost: 4/5 - Low effort/usage
Programming effort however given 
- ROI: 3/5 - Small group of people who come in contact with it, only data summarization, time savings for the initial document review
- Risk: 3/5 - Inaccuracy can lead to misinterpretation
- Strategic Alignment: 2/5 - Qualitative decision support, time savings for employees

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TRI / TBA
- **Involved Teams:** SD / BD / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Requirements specifications are available
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection due to customer documents,
Structure and scope of documents
Correct definition of keywords + continuous development  
- **Timeline:** End of 2026
- **Additional Comments:** Legal clarification of data protection

### 2. Target Prices (Priority: 1)

**Owner:** HMI

**Problem Statement:**
Target prices make up 50% of inquiries, often without profit

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic creation of target prices as indications 

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 4/5 - Input of standard information/basic data analogous to CCT
- Cost: 4/5 - Higher usage
Simple data processing / technical implementation 
- ROI: 5/5 - Reduction of calculation effort, freeing up resources for projects
- Risk: 5/5 - Target price, no contractual binding
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - No resource binding, concentration on important/strategic projects

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TBA / TRI
- **Involved Teams:** SD / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** Data available
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection
Cost breakdown, resource overview
- **Timeline:** Q2 / 2026
- **Additional Comments:** 

### 3. Contract (Priority: 3)

**Owner:** NKO

**Problem Statement:**
Contract Reviews/Document Reviews

**Proposed Solution:**
Automatic detection of major deviations from DUV standard

**Project Metrics:**

- Complexity: 5/5 - Searching for keywords, interpretation help
- Cost: 5/5 - Low effort/usage
Programming effort however given 
- ROI: 4/5 - Small group of people who come in contact with it, interpretation help, time savings for decision makers
- Risk: 1/5 - Misinterpretation can lead to high follow-up costs
Data security with confidential customer information?
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - Risk management

**Project Brief:**

- **Project Sponsor:** TRI / TBA / Legal
- **Involved Teams:** SD / BD / Legal / IT
- **Potential Conflicts:** IT resources
- **Required Resources:** Personnel, Budget, Technology
- **Data Availability:** DUV standard contract
Sample contract
- **GenAI Considerations:** Data protection due to customer documents,
Structure and scope of documents
Correct definition of keywords + continuous development  
- **Timeline:** Mid 2027
- **Additional Comments:** Legal clarification of data protection
