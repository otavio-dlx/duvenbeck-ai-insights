## Detailed Initiative Analysis

### 1. Market Analysis Automation (Priority: 1-A)
**Owner:** Corporate Development

**Problem Statement:**
Market and competitive analyses are time-consuming and often not up to date. Current market research requires significant manual effort, with teams spending considerable time gathering data from various sources, leading to delayed strategic decisions.

**Proposed Solution:**
AI-powered tools aggregate data in real-time and automatically create concise market overviews. Implementation of an AI-driven platform that automatically aggregates real-time market data from multiple sources including industry reports, news feeds, financial databases, and social media.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 4/5 - Not complex; however, some data is only available in download documents or behind paywalls. Regular updates/extensions of parameters may be necessary
- Cost: 4/5 - Costs may only be necessary for certain tools/websites (e.g., Orbis). Some licenses already available
- ROI: 3/5 - ROI not measurable as analysis only represents decision support → Time savings very high
- Risk: 4/5 - Risk: Reports not being used
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Data helps in analyzing possible strategic directions and in decision-making/review with shareholders = Data driven

**Project Brief:**
- **Involved Teams:** All C-Level resorts for alignment on scope of reports and topics that are relevant (Finance; Operations especially regarding production planning)
- **Potential Conflicts:** None // At most: Innovation and IT due to trend alerts
- **Data Availability:** Internal data on company performance for comparison (e.g., Rev, EBITDA, FTE Amount, PEX, Shipments etc.) + existing information about production planning etc.
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones necessary to check if data is validly pulled from WWW. Pilot design not necessary; reporting only for C-Level/Extended Management. Ethics and data protection not applicable = work only with published data. Scalability not necessary. Change management not necessary
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** Validate concrete use of data = goal is to generate action measures and recommendations (e.g., personnel reduction VW = fixed cost reduction DUV)

### 2. Competition Monitoring & Trend Alerts (Priority: 1-B)
**Owner:** To be assigned

**Problem Statement:**
New competitors, technologies, or business models are often recognized too late, leading to missed opportunities and competitive disadvantages.

**Proposed Solution:**
AI continuously monitors market trends and competitor activities and creates alerts for relevant changes.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 4/5 - Not complex; however, some data is only available in download documents or behind paywalls. Regular updates/extensions of parameters may be necessary
- Cost: 4/5 - Costs may only be necessary for certain tools/websites (e.g., Orbis). Some licenses already available
- ROI: 3/5 - ROI not measurable as analysis only represents decision support → Time savings very high
- Risk: 4/5 - Risk: Reports not being used
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - Data helps in analyzing possible strategic directions and in decision-making/review with shareholders = Data driven

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 3. Dashboard/Reporting Creation for Target Achievement (Priority: 2)
**Owner:** CEO + COO + CIO

**Problem Statement:**
High effort, no standards, little homogeneous definition in the group for reporting processes. Current reporting processes are highly fragmented across the organization, with each department using different tools, formats, and definitions.

**Proposed Solution:**
Brainstorming and development of standardized templates for all dashboards (Excel + PPT Export). Development of a centralized, automated dashboard system with standardized KPI definitions, real-time data integration from SAP and other core systems.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 3/5 - Many data needed from various tools (SAP, customer portal etc)
- Cost: 4/5 - Data exports/interfaces etc necessary to generate live real values
- ROI: 5/5 - Many FTEs throughout the group busy with reporting tasks + updates. Through automation, especially in controlling, various times can be used more efficiently
- Risk: 5/5 - No risk; Internal data. At most misinterpretation or wrong definitions
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - To make agile and fast-paced decisions, ZDF is needed at the push of a button = At the same time high reporting effort towards shareholders can be reduced and standardized = M&A necessity = Data and reporting structures necessary for possible shareholder exit

**Project Brief:**
- **Involved Teams:** Operations + Controlling + PowerBI Team = Use existing data and reports to standardize/optimize and automate them
- **Potential Conflicts:** Currently possibly ongoing project: KPI Based Steering (WPE requirements)
- **Data Availability:** Many data in Caro, customer portal, SAP, PowerBI available = Are not centrally consolidated or definitions don't match or are not exported from systems or further processed = often alignment with other systems necessary to ensure data completeness
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones // Pilot design not necessary; reporting only for C-Level/Extended Management. Ethics and data protection not applicable = work only with internal data = personal data = performance KAM = Scalability not necessary. Change management not necessary
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** Coordination with C-Level and WPE regarding alignment on scope and existing// missing reports = especially CXO and COO

### 4. Customer Review Profitability Analysis (Priority: 3-A)
**Owner:** To be assigned

**Problem Statement:**
Decisions about investments or divestments are complex and require many data points from various sources and documented problems to define optimization potential.

**Proposed Solution:**
AI evaluates existing projects and investments based on KPIs, risk, and growth potential, and provides recommendations.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 3/5 - Many data points needed from various tools (SAP, customer portal, local and central) as well as documented problems and processes to define optimization potential. Financial metrics available but other topics mostly not centrally stored = Many knowledge holders
- Cost: 4/5 - Low costs, only in-house data + irregular queries (1x per quarter per customer ??)
- ROI: 2/5 - Low ROI; Helps with quick analysis
- Risk: 2/5 - High risk if assumptions are incorrect and customer conversations are interpreted negatively
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Necessary; Wanted by CEO and helps achieve goals (EBITDA) as objective decisions can be made about expansion or exit of customer relationships

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 5. Contract Database (Priority: 3-B)
**Owner:** To be assigned

**Problem Statement:**
Renegotiations, deviations TARGET vs ACTUAL in contracts require systematic tracking and analysis.

**Proposed Solution:**
Scan of SLAs/contracts and comparison with ACTUAL values in the system.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 1/5 - Very high complexity because many TARGET data like volume are only shared sporadically by customers, or only available retrospectively = Simultaneously many documents and contracts not digitized = Basically every contract and all SLAs (which change regularly) would always need to be updated
- Cost: 3/5 - High manual updating/centralization effort
- ROI: 5/5 - Deviations and potential for renegotiations quickly and potentially proactively identifiable by AI. = Currently only checked if delivered according to contract in case of negative events or P&L result. Bonus-malus agreements are partially checked by customers and transmitted to DUV = Review and correction can be replaced by AI thus freeing resources for other topics
- Risk: 4/5 - No risk; In-house data
- Strategic Alignment: 3/5 - ...

**Project Brief:**
- **Project Sponsor:** CCO + CXO
- **Involved Teams:** COO + Site Management + Legal (Contract Management)
- **Potential Conflicts:** Central Sales vs. Decentralized Management
- **Required Resources:** Digitization and harmonization of SLA + contract data if not available in the system. Budget: None
- **Data Availability:** Contracts are available in legal systems and CRM = Completeness verification necessary
- **GenAI Considerations:** Prototype milestones necessary. Pilot design necessary if tool is to be made available to sites. Ethics and data protection not applicable = work only with internal data. Scalability N/A. Change management N/A
- **Timeline:** Q1/2026
- **Additional Comments:** None

### 6. Product Portfolio Extension (Priority: 5)
**Owner:** To be assigned

**Problem Statement:**
High effort to identify individual service extensions for customers. Analysis of potential product extensions based on existing customers requires significant manual research.

**Proposed Solution:**
Once database with all customer contracts is available, it's easy to do a gap analysis and check where upscaling is possible or not + Business Solution can be sketched by AI and potential white spots identified.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 4/5 - Once database with all customer contracts is available, it's easy to do a gap analysis and check where upscaling is possible or not + Business Solution can be sketched by AI and potential white spots identified
- Cost: 4/5 - No high costs
- ROI: 4/5 - Quick analysis and KAM plans can be created
- Risk: 0/5 - No risk
- Strategic Alignment: 5/5 - Growth, cross-selling and customer development desired and required. Entry barriers with current customer base lower than new acquisition

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*

### 7. Strategic Scenario Planning (Priority: 6)
**Owner:** To be assigned

**Problem Statement:**
Strategic decisions are often based on incomplete or outdated assumptions. Regular strategy reviews are time-intensive and require significant coordination.

**Proposed Solution:**
AI-supported scenario simulations model different strategies and their potential impacts.

**Project Metrics:**
- Complexity: 5/5 - No complexity. Through stating objectives, possible alternatives can be quickly brainstormed and scenarios evaluated faster
- Cost: 3/5 - Cannot be evaluated
- ROI: 3/5 - No ROI; Support in decision-making and faster strategy adjustment due to changed conditions = No long-term strategy workshops potentially necessary = Cost savings + Faster top-down implementation of goals and measures per resort and partially department + Savings in consulting costs
- Risk: 5/5 - Incorrect questions/info lead to wrong plans and mismatched goals
- Strategic Alignment: 4/5 - 3-5 different strategy reviews were done in 3 years = Helps with regular updates and readjustments = Securing information from knowledge holders (C-Level fluctuation)

**Project Brief:** *To be developed*
