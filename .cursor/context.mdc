# Project Context: AI Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project was created to centralize and visualize AI initiative ideas collected from comprehensive workshops conducted across all departments within Duvenbeck. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool to evaluate, prioritize, and present the most impactful AI opportunities to leadership.

## Background

### Workshop Initiative
We conducted a series of workshops with each department in the company to:
- **Educate** teams on AI capabilities and potential applications
- **Capture insights** on how AI can enhance their specific workflows and processes
- **Identify pain points** that could be addressed through AI solutions
- **Brainstorm innovative ideas** for AI implementation within their domains

### Data Collection
Each workshop resulted in a comprehensive dataset containing:
- Department-specific AI ideas and initiatives
- Problem statements and proposed solutions
- Priority assessments and feasibility evaluations
- Resource requirements and implementation considerations

These insights are stored as structured data files in the `/src/data/` folder, with one file per department.

## Project Purpose

### Primary Objectives
1. **Centralized Visualization**: Create a unified dashboard to display all captured AI ideas across departments
2. **Priority Identification**: Enable easy filtering and sorting to identify high-impact, high-feasibility initiatives  
3. **Strategic Evaluation**: Provide tools to assess ideas based on multiple factors (complexity, impact, alignment, etc.)
4. **Executive Reporting**: Present the most promising AI opportunities in a clear, actionable format for the CIO and leadership team

### Key Stakeholders
- **Department Teams**: Contributors who provided ideas and insights during workshops
- **CIO**: Primary decision-maker who will use this dashboard to evaluate and prioritize AI investments
- **Leadership Team**: Strategic stakeholders who need visibility into AI initiative potential across the organization

## Dashboard Functionality

The dashboard enables users to:
- Browse all collected AI ideas by department or category
- Apply filters to find ideas matching specific criteria (priority, complexity, impact, etc.)
- View detailed information about each initiative including problem statements, solutions, and assessments
- Prioritize initiatives using a multi-factor evaluation matrix
- Generate reports and visualizations for executive presentations

## Success Criteria

The project is successful when:
- All workshop insights are accurately represented and accessible
- The CIO can quickly identify the top AI opportunities worth pursuing
- Leadership has clear visibility into AI potential across all departments
- The dashboard facilitates informed decision-making about AI investments and resource allocation

## Data Structure

Each department file contains:
- **Home section**: Department metadata and workshop information
- **Ideas array**: Structured list of AI initiatives with standardized fields for evaluation
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for global accessibility

This structured approach ensures consistency across departments while maintaining the unique insights and priorities of each team.
