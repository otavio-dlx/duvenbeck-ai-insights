        "problemStatement": "Currently, market analyses require significant manual effort, with teams spending 15-20 hours per week gathering data from various sources. Information becomes outdated quickly, and competitive intelligence is often fragmented. This leads to delayed strategic decisions and missed opportunities in fast-moving markets.",
        "proposedSolution": "Implementation of an AI-driven platform that automatically aggregates real-time market data from multiple sources including industry reports, news feeds, financial databases, and social media. The system will generate automated reports, competitive benchmarking, and trend analysis with customizable dashboards for different stakeholder groups.",
        "businessCase": "Time savings of 80% in market research activities (equivalent to 12-16 hours per week), improved data accuracy and timeliness, better competitive positioning through early trend identification, estimated annual savings of €150,000 in research costs plus opportunity value of faster market response.",
        "timeline": "Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Platform selection and data source integration. Phase 2 (Months 4-6): AI model training and dashboard development. Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Testing, refinement, and user training. Full implementation by Month 9.",

        "riskAssessment": "Low-Medium risk. Main risks include data quality issues, integration challenges with existing systems, and user adoption. Mitigation strategies include phased rollout, comprehensive training, and fallback to manual processes during transition.",
        "successMetrics": "Reduction in research time by 80%, increase in market report frequency by 300%, improvement in competitive intelligence accuracy by 50%, user satisfaction score >4.0/5.0, ROI achievement within 18 months."

        "department": "Corporate Development",
        "problemStatement": "Current reporting processes are highly fragmented across the organization, with each department using different tools, formats, and definitions. This creates inconsistencies, requires significant manual effort (estimated 25+ FTE hours weekly across all departments), and makes cross-departmental analysis difficult. Stakeholders receive delayed and often incomparable information.",
        "proposedSolution": "Development of a centralized, automated dashboard system with standardized KPI definitions, real-time data integration from SAP and other core systems, and customizable views for different user groups. The system will include automated report generation, drill-down capabilities, and mobile access for executives.",
        "businessCase": "Reduction in reporting effort by 70% (saving approximately 17 FTE hours weekly), improved data consistency and accuracy, faster decision-making through real-time insights, estimated annual savings of €400,000 in operational costs, plus improved strategic agility and stakeholder satisfaction.",
        "timeline": "Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Requirements gathering and system design. Phase 2 (Months 3-5): Core platform development and data integration. Phase 3 (Months 6-8): Dashboard creation and testing. Phase 4 (Months 9-10): Training and rollout. Full deployment by Month 10.",

        "riskAssessment": "Medium risk. Key risks include data quality issues, resistance to standardization, integration complexity, and change management challenges. Mitigation includes stakeholder engagement, phased rollout, comprehensive training program, and dedicated change management support.",
        "successMetrics": "70% reduction in manual reporting time, 100% standardization of KPI definitions across departments, real-time data refresh (vs. current weekly/monthly cycles), user adoption rate >85%, accuracy improvement >95%, executive satisfaction score >4.5/5.0."
